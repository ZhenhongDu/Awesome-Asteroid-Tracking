## Implementations
#### Point-based method
- [asteroid detection from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images](https://github.com/xquery/sdss_asteroid_detect) | [Code](https://github.com/xquery/sdss_asteroid_detect)
> Small collection of utilities for detecting moving objects within sdss images.

- [OpenStarstacker](http://openstartracker.org/) | [Code](https://github.com/UBNanosatLab/openstartracker)
> A fast, robust, open source startracker based on a new class of baysian startracker algorithms
#### Stripe-based method
- [ASTRiDe](https://github.com/dwkim78/ASTRiDE) | [code](https://github.com/dwkim78/ASTRiDE)
> ASTRiDE aims to detect streaks in astronomical images using a "border" of each object and their morphological parameters.


- [pyradon](https://github.com/guynir42/pyradon) | [Code](https://github.com/guynir42/pyradon)
> Streak detection Python package, based on the Fast Radon Transform (FRT).


- [Towards Asteroid Detection in Microlensing Surveys with Deep Learning](https://github.com/pcowan-astro/MOA-Asteroids) | [Code](https://github.com/pcowan-astro/MOA-Asteroids) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02239)
> A YOLOv4 network was used to detect asteroid tracklets.

## Papers
#### Image processing-based method
